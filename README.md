Transformed San Francisco's Airbnb Data: I leveraged Python to clean the Airbnb dataset and prepare the data for analysis. This involved handling inconsistencies, identifying missing values, and ensuring data quality.

Location: Russian Hill boasts the highest prices, while Crocker Amazon offers budget stays.

Room Type Insights: Shared rooms lead the pack in average price, followed by entire homes/apartments. 

Booking Trends: Bookings peak in February and during the fall season.
